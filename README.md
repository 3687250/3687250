- 👋 Hi, I'm @ Xiaoyu
- 👀 I have been interested in high-tech, mechanical repair, and electronic products since I was young...
- 🌱 I am currently learning Java, and I don't know how to do it. Initially, I wanted to create a web page or a very impressive program to play with, but so far I haven't made any progress. From Android to Java, from Java basics to Java frameworks, this is where I first met on May 12, 2024...
- 💞️ I hope to cooperate... I hope to have a life mentor to guide me and answer my questions and doubts...
- 📫 How to contact me... Wei: h463678923
- 😄 Pronouns:...
- ⚡ Interesting fact:... The only thing that comes to mind now is pretending to be forced
